NSB's Oculus Rift Linux test Library 
------------------------------------
Version: v0.1.0

Disclaimer:
-----------
This code is raw.  Really raw.  Like a-skilled-vet-could-still-revive-it raw. 

Copyright:
----------
This code is mostly a port from the Oculus Rift SDK v1.5.  It has been 
stripped down to basic C, but it contains algorithms designed by the 
Oculus team and not myself.

gl-matrix.c is from https://github.com/Coreh/gl-matrix.c and is 
Copyright 2011 Brandon Jones.  The license is open and permissive for
personal and commercial applications.

Purpose:
--------
I like Linux.  I'll take OSX in a pinch, but I do nearly all of my work under
Linux, so I was a little disappointed to see that the initial Rift support was 
Win32 only.  I'm also impatient, so I decided to see if I could port the win32
stuff to Linux while I wait for better support from Oculus.  

As of today, Oculus has released SDK v2.1 which includes a little more OSX 
support, so that's a step in the right direction, but still no Linux.

Still to do:
------------
- Create a simple scene to be viewed in stereo
- GL shader for stereo rendering
- Sensor Range settings 
- Sensor HID info seems to return garbage
- Plenty of code cleanup
- Update Sensor Fusion algorithms to v2.1 SDK
- Sensor "Up" needs to be inverted


Prerequesites:
--------------
freeglut
gl headers
pthreads (for the thread tests anyways)
libusb-dev
libudev-dev
hidapi ( from https://github.com/signal11/hidapi )

Extras:
-------
gl-matrix.c is a vector/matrix/quat library from 
https://github.com/Coreh/gl-matrix.c . This choice was pretty arbitrary.
I didn't want to write one myself and I wanted one with a permissive 
license.  Only a handful of functions are actually used for the tracker 
updates, but having a whole library available is handy, so here it is.


Building:
---------
You should be able to just 'make' and then:

./gltest 
./threadtest 
./consoletest 
./hidapitest

...I know, I hate it when people say that too.  If you have problems
though, contact me at the locations below and I'll try to 
help if I can.

Running:
--------
Make sure that you have read/write permission to the proper raw HID device
for your Rift.  Check 'dmesg' output just after you plug it into USB and
then 'chmod 777 /dev/hidrawX' where X is the proper number

consoltest: Straight CLI with quaternion orientation logging in a select loop
threadtest: Straight CLI with quaternion logging, but polling is handled by a thread
gltest1: GL window with polling in a thread
